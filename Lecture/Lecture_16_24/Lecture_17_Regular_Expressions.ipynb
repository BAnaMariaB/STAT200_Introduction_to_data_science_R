        "Hi class. Welcome to today's lecture. So today, we're going to cover more string processing. And in particular, we're going to cover something called regular expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, in last lecture we actually learned how to process and manipulate strings using several different base R functions, such as nchar for the number of characters in a string, toupper to convert strings to all uppercase, and substring to subset different patterns within a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "But in particular, toward the end we also learned another set of functions that can search for a fixed string pattern in a vector of character data types — or a character vector, or you could call that a vector of strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "So there are these functions here, very special regular expression functions. Now, just to recap: we have grepl. The \"l\" in grepl stands for logical, right? Because it outputs a Boolean or logical, which represents if a pattern is in a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "So just to recap: if I defined this character vector here with two entries, the first being \"Panda Express\" and the second being \"Vallartas,\" which are two different places to eat.\n",
        "\n",
        "I can call grepl, and I want to say I'm searching for the pattern \"Express\" with a capital E in each of the strings within this vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "And if I run that, I get a TRUE and a FALSE. The first element is TRUE because the first string in this vector contains this pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the second string in the vector does not.\n",
        "\n",
        "So that's how grepl works.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's also grep, which is very similar to grepl, but instead of outputting a logical vector, it outputs just a numeric vector — right — about which indexes or elements of the character vector contain that pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "So when I run it on this same character vector here, it outputs a single 1. And this is because the first entry of this character vector contains the pattern \"Express.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It doesn't output anything for 2, because the second string in that character vector does not contain this pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, something I didn't go over is: there is another option or argument for the grep function — it's called value. And the function of this argument value just simply outputs the corresponding string that contains your pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "So what I mean by that is: since the first element of this character vector contains \"Express,\" if you put value = TRUE, it just gives you that entire string.\n",
        "\n",
        "If I run that, it outputs the first entry of that character vector. This is useful when you don't want to just extract the numeric index or location of the string containing the pattern — it essentially outputs the entire string itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then there's gsub, which just replaces a pattern in a string x with some replacement string. So again, if we're working with this same character vector — if I wanted to convert this \"E\" to a lowercase, I could say: search for this pattern in this character vector, and wherever you find that pattern, replace that pattern with this pattern here, which is just lowercase \"e\".\n",
        "\n",
        "So if I show that, you can see now that there is indeed a lowercase \"e\" there.\n",
        "\n",
        "And then finally, a bit more complicated is the gregexpr function. And this actually searches for the location of the pattern and outputs that location.\n",
        "\n",
        "So if I were to say, \"search in this character vector for this pattern and give me the location of the first character in that pattern,\" well, here we have a 7, and if we count:\n",
        "\n",
        "There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then the 7th character is the \"E\", so it gives us the location of this pattern in this longer string.\n",
        "\n",
        "And for the second entry here, it outputted a -1, just because \"Vallartas\" doesn't contain anything related to this pattern here. So it outputs a negative number, saying there was no match. All right. So that's a quick recap.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, as I said earlier,\n",
        "\n",
        "all of these functions — the way we learned them — was just searching for a fixed string pattern. So \"Express\" is just fixed — we are searching exactly for that pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "The thing is, what if these patterns that we're searching for aren't fixed? What if we want to search for a range of different patterns?\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Say we have this vector here of several descriptions of individual heights. The first is \"my height is 5 foot 6\", second one says \"5 foot 11 inches\", and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we could use grepl to search for this exact pattern of a \"4\" within this character vector,\n",
        "\n",
        "and then print it.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can ignore this, but this is just using the cat function and printing a new line in between each entry.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice here: it outputs a vector of logicals where the first four are FALSE and the last two are TRUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "And the reason for this is: we have a \"4\" here and a \"4\" here in the last two entries, right? So there's a correct match there. However, there aren't any \"4\"s in the earlier entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The thing is, what if we want to search for a range of numbers,\n",
        "\n",
        "such as all heights that contain a digit 2 to 4 — right — 2, 3, or 4? Well, you can perform this using the same function, but you need a different syntax called regular expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "So I'll just show a quick example here, but then I'll go in depth into how this works in future videos.\n",
        "\n",
        "So I could say: grep — search for \"2 to 4\" — and then print the result. Now you see that the middle two are also TRUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "So here we have a 4, we have a 4,\n",
        "\n",
        "but in the middle two we have a \"3\", which is in the range 2 to 4,\n",
        "\n",
        "and we have a \"2\", which is in the range 2 to 4 as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "So we're actually able to search for a range of patterns — not only for numbers, but also letters — search for strings that start with certain letters, and so on, using this syntax of regular expressions.\n",
        "Alright. So how did we find strings that contain that pattern of a range of numbers in the last lecture video? Right? Well, let's look at this script once again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Single digit ranges in our pattern string that we're searching are specified with square brackets and a hyphen. So if you want to search for any digits in a string that are ranging from 2 to 4, you would include the quotes (because that's a string pattern), the bracket (which tells R \"I'm going to include a range\"), and then the numbers for which you'd like to search.\n",
        "\n",
        "So again, this was the result from the last video.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, to view which entries in the character vector satisfy your regular expression pattern, there are two options. For one, remember grepl outputs a logical vector. So we can use subsetting to pull the entries in this character vector corresponding to TRUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the last four are TRUE, we can use subsetting to pull the last four strings from that vector. That's what I do here.\n",
        "\n",
        "So I have results, which is just this logical vector. I say I want from the vector everything that's TRUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "And it simply outputs all the strings that satisfy the pattern of having a number ranging from 2 to 4. But again, if I used value = TRUE, like we went over earlier in the last video, we can simply print that result and it will print these strings as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alright. So we've matched a range of numbers. Now we are working with text which will likely contain letters. So what if we want to match a range of letters?\n",
        "\n",
        "We can do it using similar syntax from before — using that bracketed syntax. We just specify a range of letters by including that range of letters within square brackets and separating the range with a dash or a hyphen.\n",
        "\n",
        "We read this script as: we would like to search for a string containing a lowercase letter, or anything from a lowercase letter a to a lowercase letter z. So this is the same character vector defined before.\n",
        "\n",
        "Except now, I'm searching for anything that contains a letter from a to z. Remember, you need these square brackets and this hyphen, which signifies a range. If I run this and print the result, we get: TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we look at this result: the first is TRUE — the string contains at least one lowercase letter. The second string doesn't. The third does (an \"m\"). The fourth doesn't. The fifth does (\"TALL\"). Notice how the last doesn't, despite containing letters — because we're only searching for lowercase letters, whereas \"HEIGHT\" here is all uppercase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another example: we can read this script as follows — I want to search for a string that contains a lowercase letter a through i. So I'm narrowing the range to just a through i and searching through this character vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice we have TRUE, FALSE, and now the third one turns to FALSE. The reason is although \"I\" is contained in this third string, it's uppercase — so it's not included here. This is also uppercase, so it also outputs FALSE. No pattern match.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like searching for a range of lowercase letters, we can search for a range of uppercase letters using the same syntax, but with capital letters. So I would read this script as: search for a string in this character vector that contains a letter A through I.\n",
        "\n",
        "If I run that, we get: FALSE, FALSE, and TRUE. Notice how this is now TRUE — that third entry — because there's a capital I matching with the I here.\n",
        "\n",
        "And the last entry is TRUE because we have an all-caps \"HEIGHT\" here.\n",
        "\n",
        "All the other ones are FALSE, because we're not matching any lowercase letters, and the capital M is not within the range of A through I.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also mix the two together by including both lowercase and uppercase ranges in that same bracket syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "I would read this script as: search for a string in this character vector that contains a letter in the range of lowercase a through i and uppercase A through I.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now you see: TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE — basically anything with text is TRUE. The second and fourth entries are FALSE, because they do not contain any text at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "One more thing with letters: you can also separate them by a comma if you don’t want to search for a range, but just a few specific letters. Here I’m changing the pattern to Hh — uppercase and lowercase H.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are searching for a string in this character vector containing an uppercase H or a lowercase h.\n",
        "\n",
        "If I run that, you’ll see that everything is FALSE except the first and last entries. The first contains a lowercase h, and the last contains an uppercase H.\n",
        "\n",
        "So that’s searching for ranges of letters or patterns containing letters.\n",

        "\n",
        "Now, instead of matching a range of numbers or a range of letters occurring anywhere in a string within a character vector, we can actually match letters or numbers at the start or end of a string as well. Here's an example of using regular expressions to find a pattern at the start of a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "The start of a string is matched using the caret symbol (^) — this little arrow pointing up. So the caret symbol is placed in quotes.\n",
        "\n",
        "We would like to search for a string in this character vector that starts with the letter a through i, or starts with the letter A through I. The way we do this is: we want to start with any of the range of letters inside brackets, either lowercase or uppercase A through I.\n",

        "When we run that, we only have three entries within this character vector — the first two produce TRUE.\n",

        "This is because the first letter in the first entry starts with a capital I, which is in the specified range. The first letter in the second entry starts with a lowercase i, also in the range. However, the third entry starts with a capital P, which is not within the range of A through I.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, if we remove the starting caret symbol from that first entry, all three strings produce TRUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is because the i in the middle is still matched. So the caret symbol (^) essentially allows you to search for patterns at the beginning of a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, you can use the dollar symbol ($) to search for patterns at the end of a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "We would like to search for a string within this character vector that ends with an exclamation point.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our grep statement, we're searching this character vector for an exclamation point at the end. We use the dollar symbol to indicate we're searching for a character at the end of the string. The character we're searching for comes before the dollar symbol.\n",
        "\n",
        "So we want the string to end with an exclamation point.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we run this, we get FALSE, FALSE, and TRUE, because the third string ends with an exclamation point.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, if we were to remove the dollar symbol and just search for an exclamation point, then the first and third strings return TRUE, because there's an exclamation point in the middle of the first string and at the end of the third.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alright. So there are many, many special characters that we can use within regular expressions to search for string patterns. I'll just cover a few here today — the most important ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we have the asterisk (*). This represents zero or more instances of a character that is shown previously. What that means is: if we look at this script, it reads — we are searching for a string in this character vector containing:\n",
        "\n",
        "    an \"A\",\n",
        "\n",
        "    then a \"1\",\n",
        "\n",
        "    but that \"1\" can occur zero or more times (because of the asterisk),\n",
        "\n",
        "    followed by \"AB\".\n",
        "\n",
        "If we run this, all of them are TRUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why? Because our rule is that we want it to start with an \"A\" — and all the strings in the character vector start with \"A\". Then we need a \"1\". All of these have a \"1\", except for the first one. But because of the asterisk, we're saying the \"1\" can occur zero or more times — so the first entry still qualifies. Then it's followed by \"AB\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"1\" can occur zero or more times. For example, it occurs four times in one entry, followed by \"AB\", so there's still a match.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, similar to the asterisk, we can use a plus symbol (+).\n",
        "\n",
        "The plus symbol represents one or more instances. So if we take the same example but replace the asterisk with a plus:\n",
        "\n",
        "We are searching for a string that:\n",
        "\n",
        "    contains an \"A\",\n",
        "\n",
        "    then contains a \"1\" one or more times,\n",
        "\n",
        "    followed by \"AB\".\n",
        "\n",
        "If we run this, the first string returns FALSE, and everything else is TRUE. That’s because the first string starts with an \"A\", but there are zero \"1\"s, and we need one or more. The rest have at least one \"1\", so they satisfy the pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the question mark (?) represents zero or one instance of the preceding character — not more than one.\n",
        "\n",
        "So in the script using the question mark, we’re searching for a string that:\n",
        "\n",
        "    contains an \"A\",\n",
        "\n",
        "    then a \"1\" that occurs zero or one time,\n",
        "\n",
        "    followed by a \"B\".\n",
        "\n",
        "If we run this, the first two strings return TRUE, and the rest are FALSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why? All strings start with \"A\". But for the first two, \"1\" occurs zero or one time. For the others, it occurs two or more times, which does not satisfy the condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "And finally, the period (.) represents any single character — it can be a number, letter, or symbol.\n",
        "\n",
        "So if the pattern is:\n",
        "\n",
        "    starts with \"A\",\n",
        "\n",
        "    followed by any single character,\n",
        "\n",
        "    then \"B\",\n",
        "\n",
        "Only the second string is TRUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why? The first string starts with \"A\" and ends with \"B\", but there is no character in between — so it's not a match. Others have more than one character between \"A\" and \"B\". Only the second has exactly one character in between.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we modify the first string, for example changing it to \"A7B\", now the pattern matches — \"A\" followed by a single character (\"7\") and then \"B\" — and the result is TRUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alright. Now we're getting into more advanced regular expressions. Just like with defining strings in the last lecture, we can also use escape characters — or escaping. In the last lecture, we used a single backslash to include some specific formatting like a quote.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, to include this quote so it doesn't conflict with the surrounding quotes, we had to put a backslash to let R know we actually want to include that quote inside the string.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we don't use the escape character, R gets confused — and we end up with an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "In regular expressions, there are other special characters as well, and they have special meanings. But they can conflict with the single backslash in a regular string, so we end up needing two backslashes when using regular expressions in R.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first such special character requiring escaping is the digit special character, written as \\\\d.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is equivalent to specifying a range of digits 0-9. So if we search in a character vector for any pattern containing digits 0–9, we’ll find matches in all strings containing numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of using [0-9], we can write \\\\d — a shorthand for any single digit. You need to use two backslashes (\\\\) or else you'll get an error, because \\d is a special regex character and needs to be escaped in R strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "With two backslashes, the results are equivalent to the earlier example — TRUE for each entry that contains at least one digit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, you can also specify the number of digits you're searching for using curly braces {} after \\\\d.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example: \\\\d{3,4} means you are searching for a string containing three or four digits in a row.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you modify an entry to have four digits in a row and run this search, it will return TRUE for that entry.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can try other combinations too. For instance, \\\\d{2} will match only entries with exactly two digits in a row.\n",
        "\n",
        "So if an entry has only one or more than two digits in a row, it won’t match.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is helpful when searching for numeric patterns with a specific number of digits, such as phone numbers, ZIP codes, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "A second special character we’ll cover is the whitespace special character, written as \\\\s.\n",
        "\n",

        "Alright. So we're almost done covering all the new content before we jump into a sort of longer example. But first I want to cover a very useful and important function called regmatches. This is a new function that can be used in conjunction with some of the regular expression functions to extract the patterns for which we're searching — not the entire string, but the actual pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "So far, we've learned to find ranges of patterns within a vector of strings — ranges of numbers and letters. But if we want to extract that actual pattern we're matching — for example, we have a vector of height descriptions, and we want to extract just the height for data analysis — we can use regmatches.\n",
